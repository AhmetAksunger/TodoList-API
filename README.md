## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://imgtr.ee/images/2023/04/24/8KDNq.png)

This is a Todo List API created with Java Spring. It allows users to create an account and log in. Only authorized users can use the API to manage their Todo Lists and Todo List Items. The API is connected to a Postgre database, which includes five tables: Users, Roles, User Role Junctions, Todo Lists, and Todo Items.

The API contains several endpoints that allow users to manage their todo lists and items, such as creating, updating, and deleting them. These endpoints are restricted based on the user's authorization level, ensuring that only the user can manage their own todo lists and items. If the input is invalid, the API will handle it appropriately using a strong error handling mechanism.

## Built With

Java Spring & PostgreSQL
**Dependencies**
- Spring JPA Data
- Spring WEB
- Spring Security
- Spring DevTools
- Spring Validation
- Lombok
- OAuth2
- Model Mapper
- PostgreSQL Driver

## Getting Started

To use this API, you'll need to have Java and Spring installed on your computer. You'll also need to clone this repository and set up a Postgre database. Then fill the application.properties based on your database


### Installation

application.properties can be found in the following directory
``src/main/resources/application.properties``

**application.properties**
```application.properties
server.port=8000
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect = org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.hibernate.show-sql=false
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/todo
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=12345
spring.jpa.properties.javax.persistence.validation.mode = none
```
Change "todo" to your database name
``
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/todo
`` 
Fill the username and password fields based on your PostgreSQL application.
``
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=12345
``

Also you can change the server port.
``
server.port=8000
``

## Usage

To use this API, you'll need to make requests to the various endpoints using a tool like Postman or curl. The Admin account is added to the database as soon as the application runs.
``username: "admin"``
``password: password``
